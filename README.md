# Local-Farmer-Market-Database


# Project Description
The **Local Farmer's Market Database** is designed to help market organizers efficiently manage vendors, product listings, and market schedules. Farmer's markets typically have a wide range of vendors selling fresh produce, handmade goods, and local products. This database provides a centralized system to streamline the process of tracking vendors, managing product catalogs, and scheduling market events. It also enhances the experience for vendors and customers by improving searchability and organization.
